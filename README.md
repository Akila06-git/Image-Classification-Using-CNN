# Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
This project aims to classify the images in the given dataset as cats or dogs using convolutional neural networks(CNN)
The Cats vs Dogs Image Classification project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately distinguish between images of cats and dogs. Leveraging TensorFlow and the built-in cats_vs_dogs dataset, the model is trained on thousands of labeled images. 
The project includes data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and testing with custom images. It demonstrates how deep learning can be effectively applied to binary image classification tasks.
